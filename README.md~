# Heart Disease Predector
This project is about creating a Heart Disease Predector using Supervised Learning.

## Introduction  
Having a healthy body is the key for you to achieve all the things/goals that you have been dreamed of. While our heart is the engine of our body, but not so much people really pay attention to it until a heart failure catch them off guard.  

This is why I think early detection of heart disease is very important. So people can be treated earlier and possibly saving their life. This is why I want to build a system to help doctors better classify or reinforce their decisions. And hopefully that could also possibly saves medical expenses, productivity lost, and more importantly saving a friend or family member of someone.
